1. Producer-Consumer Problem (Bounded Buffer Problem)

    Description: There are two types of threads: producers and consumers. Producers generate data and place it in a buffer, while consumers retrieve data from the buffer. The problem is to ensure that producers don't add data to a full buffer, and consumers don't remove data from an empty buffer, maintaining synchronization.
    Concepts: Synchronization, mutual exclusion, condition variables.

2. Dining Philosophers Problem

    Description: Five philosophers sit around a table with five chopsticks. A philosopher must pick up both the left and right chopstick to eat. The challenge is to ensure no deadlocks (where everyone waits forever) or starvation (where some philosophers never get to eat) occur.
    Concepts: Deadlock, resource allocation, synchronization, starvation.

3. Readers-Writers Problem

    Description: There are multiple readers and writers accessing a shared data structure (e.g., a database). Readers can access the data concurrently, but writers require exclusive access. The problem is ensuring that readers and writers are properly synchronized to avoid inconsistent states or starvation.
    Concepts: Synchronization, mutual exclusion, starvation, fairness.

4. Sleeping Barber Problem

    Description: A barber has a shop with a limited number of waiting chairs. If there are no customers, the barber sleeps. When a customer arrives, they either wake up the barber if heâ€™s asleep or wait in a chair. If all chairs are full, the customer leaves. The challenge is coordinating the barber and customers.
    Concepts: Synchronization, mutual exclusion, condition variables.

5. Cigarette Smokers Problem

    Description: Three smokers sit at a table. One has tobacco, one has paper, and one has matches. An agent places two of the three ingredients on the table, and the smoker with the remaining ingredient rolls and smokes a cigarette. The challenge is to synchronize the smokers and the agent.
    Concepts: Synchronization, deadlock prevention, resource sharing.

6. The Elevator (Lift) Algorithm Problem

    Description: Simulating an elevator system where requests are made to different floors. The challenge is ensuring that the elevator services requests efficiently without getting stuck in loops or starvation.
    Concepts: Scheduling, starvation, resource management.

7. The Sleeping Teaching Assistant Problem

    Description: Similar to the Sleeping Barber, students are working on assignments and occasionally need help from a teaching assistant. The assistant sleeps when no students need help, and wakes up when a student arrives. If the assistant is busy, students wait in a queue.
    Concepts: Synchronization, condition variables.

8. The Producer-Consumer with Multiple Buffers

    Description: A variation of the producer-consumer problem where there are multiple shared buffers instead of just one, making the synchronization more complex.
    Concepts: Resource sharing, synchronization, mutual exclusion.

9. The Dining Savages Problem

    Description: A group of savages is fed by a single cook. There is a pot that can hold a limited number of servings. When the pot is empty, one savage wakes the cook to refill the pot. The problem is to coordinate access to the pot and the cook efficiently.
    Concepts: Synchronization, mutual exclusion, resource allocation.

10. The Fifo Reader-Writer Problem

    Description: A variation of the readers-writers problem that prioritizes readers or writers differently. In the first-in-first-out (FIFO) version, requests are handled in the order they arrive to ensure fairness.
    Concepts: Fairness, synchronization, mutual exclusion.

11. The Cigarette Smokers Problem

    Description: Three smokers sit at a table with three ingredients (tobacco, paper, matches). The agent provides two ingredients, and the smoker with the third completes the cigarette. The challenge is proper coordination of the agent and the smokers.
    Concepts: Deadlock, race condition, synchronization.

12. Barrier Synchronization Problem

    Description: A barrier is used to make sure multiple threads (or processes) stop at a certain point before continuing, ensuring that all threads have reached the barrier before any thread proceeds.
    Concepts: Synchronization, mutual exclusion, coordination.

13. The Bridge Crossing Problem

    Description: A single-lane bridge must be crossed by cars from both directions. The problem is to ensure that cars from one direction don't block those coming from the other, avoiding deadlock and allowing for fair passage.
    Concepts: Deadlock prevention, synchronization, resource sharing.

14. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) Problem

    Description: A general problem of ensuring that only one thread is allowed to access a critical section of code at a time to prevent data races or inconsistent states.
    Concepts: Mutual exclusion, critical section, deadlock.

15. The Call Center Problem

    Description: A problem where there are multiple phone lines and customer service representatives. The goal is to ensure that incoming calls are assigned to free representatives efficiently, and calls are not dropped or lost.
    Concepts: Synchronization, resource allocation.
