Concurrent implementations - These implementations are part of java.util.concurrent.

* ConcurrentLinkedQueue - An unbounded first in, first out (FIFO) queue based on linked nodes.
* LinkedBlockingQueue - An optionally bounded FIFO blocking queue backed by linked nodes.
* ArrayBlockingQueue - A bounded FIFO blocking queue backed by an array.
* PriorityBlockingQueue - An unbounded blocking priority queue backed by a priority heap.
* DelayQueue - A time-based scheduling queue backed by a priority heap.
* SynchronousQueue - A simple rendezvous mechanism that uses the BlockingQueue interface.
* LinkedBlockingDeque - An optionally bounded FIFO blocking deque backed by linked nodes.
* LinkedTransferQueue - An unbounded TransferQueue backed by linked nodes.
* ConcurrentHashMap - A highly concurrent, high-performance ConcurrentMap implementation based on a hash table. This implementation never blocks when performing retrievals and enables the client to select the concurrency level for updates. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for Hashtable. In addition to implementing ConcurrentMap, it supports all of the legacy methods of Hashtable.
* ConcurrentSkipListSet - Skips list implementation of the NavigableSet interface.
* ConcurrentSkipListMap - Skips list implementation of the ConcurrentNavigableMap interface.
